### 📚 Agent Skill (Auto-Discovered)

**mixpanel-data Skill**
- Automatically activates when you mention Mixpanel, analytics, or data queries
- Provides comprehensive guidance on:
  - Library API (Python)
  - CLI commands (mp)
  - Query expressions (filter syntax, JQL)
  - Integration patterns (pandas, jq, Unix pipelines)
  - Documentation access (llms.txt)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Core concepts in SKILL.md, detailed references loaded as needed

### 🤖 Subagents (Auto-Invoked)

Specialized AI analysts that Claude invokes automatically for deep analysis workflows:

**mixpanel-analyst** - General-purpose data analyst
- Triggered: When user asks about Mixpanel data analysis, event analytics, user behavior
- Expertise: SQL queries, JQL scripts, data interpretation, insights generation
- Tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
- **Use when**: "Analyze my purchase events", "What's driving user engagement?"

**funnel-optimizer** - Conversion funnel specialist
- Triggered: Questions about conversion rates, funnel analysis, drop-off points, user journeys
- Expertise: Funnel segmentation, time-to-convert, drop-off analysis, CRO recommendations
- Tools: Read, Write, Bash
- **Use when**: "Why are users dropping off?", "Optimize my signup funnel"

**retention-specialist** - Cohort and retention expert
- Triggered: Questions about retention rates, churn, cohort behavior, user stickiness
- Expertise: Retention curves, cohort comparison, LTV indicators, sticky features
- Tools: Read, Write, Bash
- **Use when**: "What's our Day 7 retention?", "Which cohorts have best retention?"

**jql-expert** - JQL query builder
- Triggered: Complex transformations, user-level analysis, advanced JQL needs
- Expertise: JQL syntax, reducers, joins, custom aggregations, performance optimization
- Tools: Read, Write, Bash
- **Use when**: "Build a JQL query for...", "How do I calculate average events per user?"

**How it works:**
1. You ask a question or request analysis
2. Claude determines which specialist is best suited
3. The subagent runs autonomously in its own context
4. Results are returned to the main conversation
5. You can explicitly invoke: "Use the funnel-optimizer to analyze my checkout flow"

## Installation

### For End Users

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add jaredmcfarland/mixpanel_data
/plugin install mixpanel-data
```

Then restart Claude Code.

### For Development/Testing

Use the local marketplace from the repository root:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/mixpanel_data
/plugin install mixpanel-data
```

Restart Claude Code to load the plugin.

**For detailed distribution strategies, release workflows, and troubleshooting, see [DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md)**

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Credentials

```bash
claude
> /mp-auth production
```

Follow the interactive wizard to enter:
- Mixpanel service account username
- Service account secret
- Project ID
- Region (us, eu, in)

### 2. Explore Schema (Optional)

```bash
> /mp-inspect
```

Discover available events, properties, and saved funnels before fetching data.

### 3. Stream Data

```bash
> /mp-fetch events 2024-01-01 2024-01-31
```

This streams January 2024 events from the Mixpanel API.

### 4. Query Data

```bash
> /mp-query segmentation
```

Choose from segmentation, funnel, retention, or JQL queries.

### 5. Auto-Guidance

Just ask questions naturally:
```
"How do I analyze purchase events from Mixpanel?"
"What's the revenue by country?"
"Show me user retention curves"
```

The skill activates automatically to guide you.

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick Setup → Query → Analyze

```bash
/mp-auth production
/mp-inspect events
/mp-query segmentation
```

### Pattern 2: Guided Discovery

```
User: "I want to analyze Mixpanel purchase events"
Claude: [Activates skill automatically]
        "First, let's configure credentials with /mp-auth..."
```

### Pattern 3: Advanced Analysis

```bash
# Stream specific events with filters
/mp-fetch events 2024-01-01 2024-01-31 --events "Purchase" --where 'properties["amount"] > 100'

# Build complex JQL query
/mp-query jql

# Or ask for help
User: "Help me build a funnel analysis for signup → purchase"
```

## Design Philosophy

### Commands = Actions (Explicit Control)

Slash commands give users **explicit control** over operations:
- `/mp-auth` → "Configure credentials NOW"
- `/mp-inspect` → "Explore schema NOW"
- `/mp-fetch` → "Stream data NOW"
- `/mp-query` → "Query data NOW"

### Skill = Knowledge (Auto-Discovery)

The skill provides **automatic guidance** when needed:
- Mentions "Mixpanel" → Skill activates
- Asks about "analytics" → Skill provides context
- References "JQL" → Skill loads query expression docs

### Progressive Disclosure

All components minimize context usage:
- **Commands**: Load only when invoked
- **Skill**: Core in SKILL.md, detailed references loaded as needed
- **Subagents**: Run in separate context, return only results
- **Result**: Maximum context for conversation, minimal bloat
