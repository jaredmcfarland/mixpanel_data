"""Shared Literal type aliases for parameter validation.

These types are exported from the public API and can be used by
library consumers for their own type hints.

Example:
    from mixpanel_data import TimeUnit, Workspace

    def my_query(ws: Workspace, unit: TimeUnit) -> None:
        result = ws.segmentation(
            "event", from_date="2024-01-01", to_date="2024-01-31", unit=unit
        )
