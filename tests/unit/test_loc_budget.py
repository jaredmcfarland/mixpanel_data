"""LoC budget regression test for the v3 auth subsystem (T119, FR-067).

Keeps the auth subsystem from accumulating drift unbounded. Adding a
new auth file or a major code dump will fail this test, prompting the
PR author to either (a) justify the new ceiling or (b) refactor.

Scope (auth subsystem):
    - ``src/mixpanel_data/_internal/auth/*.py`` (excluding ``__init__.py``)
    - ``src/mixpanel_data/_internal/config.py``
    - The five v3 CLI command groups:
      ``cli/commands/{account, project, workspace, target, session}.py``

Note: ``cli/commands/config_cmd.py`` was originally in scope but the
file was deleted along with ``mp config convert`` (Phase 10 dropped per
"alpha free to break").

The ``api_client.py`` file is intentionally OUT of scope: it has
accumulated 8000+ lines of entity-CRUD methods (dashboards / reports /
cohorts / flags / experiments / alerts / data governance) that have
nothing to do with auth. The original spec budget assumed an
api_client split that didn't happen and is out of scope here.

Current ballpark at the 042 branch tip: 19 files / ~5,800 LoC.
Re-run ``wc -l`` against ``_auth_subsystem_files()`` to get a fresh
number; the budgets below carry ~10% headroom so a single cleanup
PR doesn't trip the test, but a substantial bloat does.
